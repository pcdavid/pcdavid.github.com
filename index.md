## about me

My name is Pierre-Charles David. I hold a PhD in Software Engineering from [University of Nantes](http://www.univ-nantes.fr/), but left the academic world a long time ago. Since 2008 I work at [Obeo](http://www.obeo.fr/) where I'm _Project Lead_ on [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius) and [Obeo Designer CE](https://www.obeodesigner.com/), which packages Sirius into a ready-to-use product (still free to use but with optional commercial suport).

I'm also the maintainer for [GMF Runtime](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.gmf-runtime), [EMF Services](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emfservices), and [Ecore Tools](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.ecoretools/), other Eclipse projects related to Sirius.
